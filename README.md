# Collatz-Conjecture

// All rights reserved by the author of this Collatz Conjecture Wikipedia page

The conjecture can be summarized as follows. Take any positive integer n.
If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. 
Repeat the process (which has been called "Half Or Triple Plus One", or HOTPO[7]) indefinitely. 
The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.

Consider the following operation on an arbitrary positive integer:

    If the number is even, divide it by two.
    If the number is odd, triple it and add one.
    
 The Collatz conjecture is: This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially.

That smallest i such that ai = 1 is called the total stopping time of n.
The conjecture asserts that every n has a well-defined total stopping time.
If, for some n, such an i doesn't exist, we say that n has infinite total stopping time and the conjecture is false.

If the conjecture is false, it can only be because there is some starting number which gives rise to a sequence that does not contain 1. 
Such a sequence might enter a repeating cycle that excludes 1, or increase without bound. No such sequence has been found.
